import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'
import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

<Callout variant="warning" title="Experiment">
  Experiment, currently not supported or maintained.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info" title="Use the AI Suggestion extension instead">
  The [AI Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/overview) extension reviews the editor
  content and suggests changes in real time. It is compatible with AI models and traditional linting
  rules like the ones shown in this example.
</Callout>

Linter can be used to check the content as per your wish and highlight it to the user. Linter extension can have multiple plugins for each task you want to achieve.

## Known issues

- There is no decoration API in Tiptap, that’s why this is a lot of ProseMirror work. Before we’ll publish that example, we’d need to find a few ways to make it more Tiptap-like. For example, it would be great to use Vue/React components for the widget.
