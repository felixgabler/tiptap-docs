With Tiptap, you can build an AI agent that can reason, define a plan, and edit your document. It makes decisions based on the user's feedback and the editor's state. This experiment showcases Tiptap's capabilities for building an text editor where you let an AI agent automate the editing process.

<Callout title="Private Beta" variant="hint">

## Tiptap AI Agent Development Toolkit

Tiptap is the rich text editor toolkit for AI Agents. Its [editor commands](/editor/api/commands) provide an interface for the AI to make precise edits to the document. And its [Content AI extensions](/content-ai/getting-started/overview) allow you to integrate AI content generation and assistance directly into your editor.

AI Agents stand apart from other AI-assisted apps for their ability to interact with their environment with **tool calling**. Currently, the Tiptap AI Agent has access to these tools:

- **Plan**: creates and updates a plan. It lets the AI break down a complex task into a series of steps.
- **Ask**: asks the user questions and requests information.
- **Write**: replaces the entire editor content.
- **Summary**: generates a summary of the changes made to the document.


We're creating more tools and templates to help developers build AI agent applications. If you have any feedback on an AI agent use case youâ€™d like to integrate, please [let us know](https://tiptap-suite.notion.site/1b601ffa3ebc80a281a8ea0b03b19bdd?pvs=105).
