import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

## What was affected

The [Link Popover UI Component](/ui-components/components/link-popover) accepted javascript: URLs, allowing potential XSS attacks.

**Affected components**
- [Link popover component](/ui-components/components/link-popover) until Jun 24, 2025, 10:01 AM GMT+2
- [Simple editor template](/ui-components/templates/simple-editor) until Jun 24, 2025, 10:01 AM GMT+2

**Not affected**

- Other UI components or templates
- The Link extension itself
- Components or templates downloaded after Jun 24, 2025, 10:01 AM GMT+2

### Why it happened
The vulnerable component bypassed editor.commands.setLink(), which normally validates URLs and blocks unsafe values like javascript:. This was done to avoid errors when the Link extension wasn’t registered, but it also skipped validation.
<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
The Link extension itself includes proper URL validation (see isAllowedUri).
</Callout>

## What’s the fix
The component now uses `editor.commands.setLink()` to enforce validation.

### How to update
