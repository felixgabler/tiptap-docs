- Supports rich text formatting, including images, links, and mentions
- Enables users to [accept and reject individual changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/review-changes) or make adjustments to generated content
- Provides a [fully customizable UI](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes) for displaying changes

## How it works

The AI Changes extension adapts to your specific text editing workflow. Integrate it in four simple steps:

2. Edit the editor's content (for example, by inserting AI-generated text)
3. [Display changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes) in the editor
4. [Review changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/review-changes) made by AI
